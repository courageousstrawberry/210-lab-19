Best movie ever! The animation style was so breathtaking.
The movie was ok. It didn't amaze me, but it wasn't bad.
This move was the worst movie that I have ever seen.
I can't believe that people hate this movie. It's the best!
I wish there was a second movie, I can't get enough of it.
The main character was annoying, but the story was too good!
I wish I never watched this movie. It was very boring.
The scenery in this movie really helped tell the story!
I wish I could watch this movie for the first time again.
This documentary taught me a lot about nature.
I learned a lot about global warming, very fascinating documentary.
I don't believe anything from this documentary, it sucks.
